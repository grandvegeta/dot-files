Hey folks, this is Vegeta. 

Here are some of my dot files, hope you like them. Feel free to use them as yours.

Here are the packages I use alongside my window managers:

1. xfce4-power-manager ( very very essential for computers running on battery)
2. networkmanager-dmenu ( easier to use than nmcli )
3. feh & nitrogen ( for wallpapers )
4. xfce4-notifyd/dunst ( for notifications )
5. picom ( window compositor )
6. pavucontrol ( for audio control )
7. lxappearance ( for selecting theme, icons and fonts )
8. Dmenu & Rofi ( for application launchers )


NOTE: Do take a look at the configs & change the $PATH as per your directories!
